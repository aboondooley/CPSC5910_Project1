First project for CPSC 5910, (Data structures) at Seattle University Computer 
Science Fundamentals Certificate. In this project we implemented a Sandpile. 

For the first lab we created a fixed length sand pile of 3X3 and created 
methods to create, check if stable, stabilize if not stable, and print the 
Sandpile.
